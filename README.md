# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is all about creating interactive dashboard for hospital emergency room and extract meaningful insights which will hep stakeholder and other decision maker to make proper future decisions.

# DATASET
The data set include the following features;

patient Id: it include the individual patients id

paatient admission date: it includes the patient admissison date and time

patient first initial; it includes patient first name

patient last name: it includes last name of patient

patient gender :it includes weither the patienrt is male or female 

patient age : it include the age of patient

patient race : it include the individual race of the patient

departmental referral: it includes departmental detail to which the patient visit

patient admission flag ; this column tel whether the patient is admitted or not 

patient satisfaction score: it include the patient satisfaction score.

patient wait time: it nclude the waiting time of patient.

# OBJECTIVE
 KPI,S Requirement
 
 number of patients:
 Count the total number of patients visiting the Emergency Room each day
 show a daily trend with an area spark line to spot pattern like busy days or seasonal trends.
 
 Average Wait time :
 Find the average time patients wait to see a medical professionals.
 Use an area sparktime to track daily change and highlights days with longer wait times
 that might need improvements.
 
 Patient satisfactory Score:
 check the average daily satisfaction score of patients to acess service quality.
 use an area sparkline to show trend ,spot drps in satisfaction and link them challenges.
 
# METHODOLOGY
  STEPS OF PROJECT
  1. BUISNESS REQUIREMENT GATERING 
  2.UNDERSTANDING OF DATA
  3.IMPORT OF DATA USING POWER QUERY
  4.DATA CLEANING AND DATA QUALITY CHECKING USING POWER QUERY
  5.CREATING CALENDAR TABLE USING POWER QUERY
  6.DATA MODELING USING POWER PIVOT
  7.ADDING REQUIRED COLUMN USING DAX in power pivot
  8.create pivot and dashboard layout
  9.CHART DEVELOPMENT AND FORMATTING
  10.DASHBOARD DEVELOPMENT 
  11.INSIGHTS GENERATION
  
# INSIGHTS
 
from the dashboard generated above we find some interesting insights;
 
1. no of patients:
 
Here we see for the year 2023 the maximum attended patient in  the emergency room of the hospital is in the month of 
jun with approx 500 patient and also in that particular month we see maximum 26 patient attended in (1st june and 22 june)
for the year 2024 the maximum attended patient in  the emergency room of the hospital is in the month of 
august with approx 530 patients and in  this month we see max noumber of attended patient is 28 which is in 1st of august.

so here we can say that for the month of (june july august) no of patient  is more than 500 so for this particular month we have to 
maintain adequate amount of medical facilities for proper treatment.
 
2.average wait time:

 The average wait time for the patient is max 35.56 in june for the year 2023
 and for the year 2024 the average time is 36.67 for the month of february,march and january.
 
 hence indicating moderate ER congestion to maintain this time we have to increase the number of medical profession for the above mention months.
 
3.patient satisfactory score:

patient satisfactory score standsout at 5 (approx) for both of years 2023,2024 
which suggesting scope for service improvement.

# RECOMMENDATION:

1.reduce average wait time by optimising triage and staffing during peak hours.

2.focus on improving patient satisfaction through faster service and better communication.

3.allocate more resources to GENERAL PACTICE AND ORTHOPEDICS as they recieve the highest referrals

4. implement special care pathways for 50-69 age group which has the highest ER Visits.

5. monitor and minimise delayed cases with real time tracking and alerts.
